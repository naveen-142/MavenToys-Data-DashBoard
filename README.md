# üß∏ Maven Toys - Business Intelligence Dashboard üìä

This project presents a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** for **Maven Toys**, a fictional retail toy company. It transforms raw sales, inventory, and product data into interactive visual insights to support data-driven decision-making.


## üîç Project Objective

To analyze and visualize:
- **Sales performance** across stores and products
- **Product profitability** based on cost vs selling price
- **Inventory status** across locations
- And provide a combined executive-level overview


## üìÅ Dataset Description

The dashboard is built using 4 key datasets:

| Table         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Sales`       | Records of daily transactions (Store ID, Product ID, Units, Date) |
| `Products`    | Product-level info (Name, Category, Cost, Price) |
| `Stores`      | Store info (City, Location Type, Open Date) |
| `Inventory`   | Stock-on-hand per product at each store |


## üìä Dashboard Pages

### 1. **Executive Overview**
- Total Revenue, Profit, Units Sold
- Revenue by City & Category
- Sales trend over time

### 2. **Product Dashboard**
- Average Cost, Selling Price, and Profit per Unit
- Visual comparison: Price vs Cost
- Product count by category

### 3. **Sales Insights**
- Top selling products
- Store-wise sales comparison
- Revenue breakdown by product category

### 4. **Inventory Management**
- Stock status by product

## üß† Key DAX Measures

```dax
Total Revenue = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Units] * RELATED(Products[Product_Price]))

Total Profit = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Units] * (RELATED(Products[Product_Price]) - RELATED(Products[Product_Cost])))

Profit_Per_Unit = Products[Product_Price] - Products[Product_Cost]

Inventory_Status = 
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    Inventory[Stock_On_Hand] = 0, "Out of Stock",
    Inventory[Stock_On_Hand] < 10, "Low",
    "Sufficient"
)
```
